### Overview Headline:
**Enhancing Educational Outcomes through Data-Driven Evaluation of Student Competency Achievement**

### Overview:
This project focused on evaluating the competency achievements of vocational high school (SMK) students. The goal was to identify competencies that need further attention and provide actionable insights for program improvement. The analysis utilized performance data to evaluate students' proficiency in various competencies, offering guidance on how to enhance educational approaches based on data-driven findings.

### Data Details:
- **Source**: Data collected from SMK students' competency scores.
- **Size**: 254 students, 1,575 records, 9 competencies.
- **Key Variables**: Student ID, Competency Name, Competency Score (ranging from 0 to 100).

### Problem Statement:
The challenge was to assess the level of competency achievement among SMK students and identify areas for further improvement in both teaching methods and the curriculum. Variability in student performance across competencies required detailed analysis to pinpoint gaps.

### Solution:
- Descriptive statistics were applied to understand the overall performance distribution of students across 9 key competencies.
- Data was categorized based on mean scores, standard deviation, and percentile values to identify competencies requiring attention.
- Key insights were drawn from competencies with the highest variance and lowest achievement to recommend focused interventions.

### Insight:
- The competency **Inovatif** exhibited the highest variability with a standard deviation of 14.23, indicating a wide performance range and highlighting the need for targeted support for students with lower scores.
- **Bekerja Sama** and **Reflektif** had the lowest achievement levels, with competency achievement rates of 85.25% and 85.82%, respectively, suggesting the need for further investigation into teaching methods and student comprehension.

### Recommendation:
1. **Differentiated Teaching Approach**: Focus on supporting students with low scores in the **Inovatif** competency through additional resources and mentoring.
2. **Review Teaching Materials**: Evaluate if the materials used in the **Inovatif** competency are too abstract or irrelevant to studentsâ€™ needs.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement a more frequent monitoring system to track individual progress, especially for students with low performance in competencies like **Bekerja Sama** and **Reflektif**.
4. **Targeted Feedback**: Provide personalized feedback to students to improve their competency in specific areas.
5. **Curriculum Improvement**: Use these insights to revise educational programs and modules for better student engagement and learning outcomes.
